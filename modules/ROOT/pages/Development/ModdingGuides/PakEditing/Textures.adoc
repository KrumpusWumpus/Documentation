= Custom Textures Guide - Pak Editing

This guide will show you how to replace textures with pak editing in Dead By Daylight.

*Prerequisites* +
▪︎ https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/[Hxd] +
▪︎ https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel[UModel] +
▪︎ https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download[Unreal Engine] (4.25.4 for Live) +
▪︎ Image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, paint.net, etc)

*Limitations* +
▪︎ Only anywhere from 1-3 textures can be changed per pak file without EAC prompting errors. +
▪︎ There can be some rendering issues with the textures in the distance. +
▪︎ PAKs need to be redone every update, so it's advised you share the UBULKs, not the pak files. +
▪︎ Small visual artifacts depending on graphics settings. (can be fixed)

== Part 1: Exporting from Dead By Daylight

*1)* Open UModel. +
*2)* Set the path to game files as the base of your Dead By Daylight files. +
*3)* Check override game detection and select Unreal Engine 4.25. +

UModel will now attempt to open all DBD game files, this process can take anywhere from a couple seconds to a couple minutes.
If it takes exceedingly long (>10 minutes) recheck all settings are correct and try again.

*5)* Find the texture you want to edit and export it with ctrl + x. +
*6)* Set where you would like the image to be saved and press OK.

== Part 2: Editing & Cooking

*1)* Open your TGA texture in your image editor of choice.

*2)* Edit it to your heart's content!

*3)* When you're finished, save as a .PNG with lossless compression. This will give you the best possible quality with transparency, although most file formats can be used for UE4, so dont feel forced to use .PNG +
*4)* Open Unreal Engine +
*5)* Create a new project with no starter content.

*6)* Go to `Edit` → `Project Settings` → `Packaging` and make sure "Use pak file" is unchecked. +
*7)* *(DEV BUILD ONLY, SKIP THIS STEP FOR LIVE)* Go to `Settings` → `Project Settings` → `Streaming` and make sure "Event Driven Loader Enabled" is unchecked. +
*8)* Now that all project set up is done, you are going to recreate the file structure of the texture you are editing in UE. For example, if I am editing Nea's Cropped Hoodie, I would make several folders in UE, starting from a folder named Characters, then Campers, Nea, Textures, Outfit009. +
*9)* Drag your edited image into the folder you just made, so I would drag my image into Outfit009.

*10)* Name the image the exact same as the original file, for example the texture im replacing is called T_NKTorso009_BC, so after importing my image I would make sure it is named T_NKTorso009_BC in Unreal. +
*11)* Save all and select `File` → `Cook Content for Windows`. +

Your file should now be cooking, this can take anywhere from a couple seconds to minutes, it typically takes longer the first time you cook.

== Part 3: Importing into DBD

*1)* Find where your Unreal Engine project is saved in File Explorer. If you dont know where it is saved, you can find it in `Settings` → `Project Settings` → `Packaging` under "Staging Directory".

*2)* Go to Saved\Cooked\WindowsNoEditor. +
*3)* You should now see a folder with the name of your project. Open that folder, and now follow the directory to where you saved your texture. +
For example, mine would be Content\MyNeaSkin. +
*4)* Copy the *ubulk* (forget about the other files) you cooked in that path. Preferably save it somewhere and make it easy to know what it is and where it should go.

*5)* Open HxD. +
*6)* Open the ubulk of your modified texture you just cooked, then open the ubulk of the original texture you saved in UModel earlier. +
*7)* Next you must open the pak file where the texture you're modifying is stored. +
*8)* With everything opened, HxD should look something like this:

*9)* Select the first few lines of the original ubulk you saved from UModel, then go to the .pak, ctrl +f to search and switch to hex search. Paste in what you copied and begin search. Afterwards, it should find the information in the .pak. Click the beginning of the selection so you are at the start.

*10)* With your pak file open and your selection at the start of the search, press CTRL + E, select Length, and paste in 2AA000 and then press OK. +
*11)* CTRL + A all the contents of your custom ubulk, copy, and then go back to the pak and paste. If all went well, you should start replacing. If you get a prompt to change file size, you did something wrong.

*12)* There are small visual artifacts when using pak edited textures on Low or Medium or High. Using Ultra will mostly correct this. If you want to stay on lower settings but fix this issue, continue following the steps below. +
*13)* Press Windows Key + R and paste in %localappdata%\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor. +
*14)* Open "GameUserSettings.ini" and set "sg.TextureQuality" equal to 4. +
*15)* Right click "GameUserSettings.ini", select Properties, check Read-Only, and Press OK.
